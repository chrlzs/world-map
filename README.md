#world map

HTML / CSS Grid representation of a world map

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14.17.4 or higher)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Navigate to the project's root directory using the terminal.

Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project.

Add your environment-specific variables to the .env file. For example:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword
SECRET_KEY=mysecret
Replace the values with your actual configuration.

In your Node.js application, use dotenv to load the environment variables from the .env file before using them. For example, if you want to access the DB_HOST variable, you can do it as follows:

// app.js
require('dotenv').config();

const dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;
// Use dbHost in your application
Run your Node.js application as you normally would:

node app.js
The application will now have access to the environment variables defined in the .env file.

Best Practices
Security: Never commit your .env file to version control systems like Git. Add .env to your .gitignore file to avoid accidentally sharing sensitive information.

Default Values: It's a good practice to provide default values for environment variables in case they are not defined in the .env file. This can be achieved using the process.env.VARIABLE_NAME || defaultValue syntax.

Environment-specific files: For different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), you can create .env.development, .env.staging, .env.production, etc., files and use the NODE_ENV environment variable to specify which one to use. For example, when running the application in development mode, set NODE_ENV=development, and dotenv will automatically load the variables from .env.development.
